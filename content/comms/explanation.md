Hi friends,

We hesitate to ask a favor of you.

We're using 5 year old laptop to create... basically all of the content you've seen from us in the last five years, including what you're seeing right now. The laptop, while served us really well and helped us realize many, many projects, is dying.

Since this is an laptop, we can't replace many of the components onboard. We have to find a new daily driver.

We're starting a "Computerathon", raising money for a new computer.

We're not used to asking for support but, as the job market is turmoil and has been a source of frustration for us, we humbly ask for your assistance.

Thank you, friends, for supporting us so far.
